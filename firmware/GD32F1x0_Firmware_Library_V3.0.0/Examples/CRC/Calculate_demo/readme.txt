  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to 
configure the CRC module. In this demo, 8 CRC codes are calculated for a 32-bit
data by configuring various control bits in the CRC control register.

  If the test passes, the success_flag variable equals 0x1 and turn on the LED1.
