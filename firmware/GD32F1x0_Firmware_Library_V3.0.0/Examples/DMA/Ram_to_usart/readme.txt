  This example is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/ GD32190R-EVAL board, it provides a description 
of how to use DMA channel1/ channel3 to transfer data from RAM memory to USART transmit data 
register.The start of transfer is triggered by software. At the end of the transfer, a 
transfer complete interrupt is generated since it is enabled. If the DMA transfer
operation is finished correctly, data stored array welcome[] will be transfered 
to a serial port tool by USART and LED1 light up.
