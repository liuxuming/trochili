    This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to
  configure the TIMER0 peripheral to generate complementary signals, to insert a 
  defined dead time value, to use the break feature and to lock the desired 
  parameters.

    TIMER0CLK is fixed to systemcoreclock, the TIMER0 prescaler is equal to 2 ,so
  the TIMER0 counter clock used is 36MHz.

    The duty cycle is computed as the following description:
    the channel 0 duty cycle is set to 25% so channel 0N is set to 75%.

    Insert a dead time equal to (63*16*4)/systemcoreclock = 56us

    Configure the break feature, active at Low level(with GND), and using the 
  automatic output enable feature.

    Use the Locking parameters level1.
