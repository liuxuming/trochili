  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to 
use the ADC to convert analog signal to digital data.The ADC is configured 
in dependent mode, inner channel16(temperature sensor channel),channel17(VREF channel) 
and channel18(VBAT/2 channel) are chosen as analog input pin. The ADC clock 
is configured to 12MHz.
  As the AD convertion begins by software,the converted data in the ADC_IDTRx register
,where the x is 0 to 2.    
 
  The analog input pin should configured to AN mode and the ADC clock should 
below 14MHz for GD32150R(28MHz for GD32190R-EVAL).
