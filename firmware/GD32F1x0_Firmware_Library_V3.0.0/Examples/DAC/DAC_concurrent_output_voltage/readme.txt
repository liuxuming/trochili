  This example is based on the GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to use DAC
concurrent mode to generate the different voltage on DAC channel output.The DAC0 
channel output pin is configured PA4, it has an output voltage of VREF/2. The 
DAC1 channel output pin is configured PA5, it has an output voltage of VREF/8.


Jumper cap (JP6) should be on 1 and 2
