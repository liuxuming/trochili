  This demo is based on the GD32F150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how 
to configure the TIMER1 peripheral in single pulse mode.
  The external signal is connected to TIMER1 CH0 pin (PA0) and the falling 
edge is used as active edge.

  The single pulse signal is output on TIMER1 CH1 pin (PA1).

  The TIMER1CLK frequency is set to systemcoreclock (72MHz),the prescaler is 
4,so the TIMER1 counter clock is 18MHz.
  
  single pulse value = (TIMER1_period - TIMER1_pulse) / TIMER1 counter clock
                     = (65535 - 11535) / 18MHz = 3.0 ms.

  Connect the TIMER1 CH0 pin (PA0)to KEY_TAMPER(PC13),When KEY_TAMPER is pressed,
a single pulse is generated.
