  This example is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows pmu how to
enter deepsleep mode and wakeup it. Press wakeup key to enter deepsleep mode ,led stop flashing.
When you press tamper key to generate an exti interrupt , mcu will be wakeuped from deepsleep mode ,
led sparks again. But the led sparks slower, because at this time HSI is the system clock.
