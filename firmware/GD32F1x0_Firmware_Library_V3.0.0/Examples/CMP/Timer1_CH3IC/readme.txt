    This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to 
  configure the comparator trigger timer 1 channel 3 input capture event, which 
  is configured to generate an interrupt on both rising and falling edge of the
  output signal.In this demo, input 3.3V(GD32150R) or 5V(GD32190R) to CMP1_IP.
  After system start-up, enable comparator and trigger interrupt,then LED3 is on.  

    Connect PA1 to +3V3(GD32150R) or +5V(GD32190R).
