  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to 
configure the comparator trigger interrupt using an external interrupt line. 
In this demo,input 3.3V(GD32150R) or 5V(GD32190R)to PA1, EXTI line 21 is 
configured to generate an interrupt on rising edge of the output signal. After 
system start-up, enable comparator and trigger interrupt, then LED2 is on. 

  Connect PA1 to +3V3 or +5V.
